\section{Introduction}

Automatically classifying songs into categories based on year, mood, artist or
genre is widely studied topic in the field of Music Information Retrieval
(MIR). A lot of research is already done \cite{mgc2011} \cite{ada2006} for
this task, as creating accurate music classifiers are useful in fields
like music search, recommendation systems etc. The categorization usually
involves extracting important features from songs and using the extracted
feature vector in classification by standard machine learning algorithms. But
finding good feature set for a particular classification problem is a non-trivial
task \cite {ada2006} \cite{feature2005}.
